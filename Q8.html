    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages. 
    It allows developers to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. 
    HTML provides the basic framework upon which websites are built, making it an essential skill for any web developer.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>CSS</b> (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. 
    With CSS, developers can apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to enhance the visual presentation of a website. 
    Together with HTML, CSS helps create attractive and user-friendly web interfaces.
